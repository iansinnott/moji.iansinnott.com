Migrate the app to a more modern stack... ðŸ¤·

Dependencies cannot be installed unfortunately. Something to do with the native dependencies of Gatsby. So many native dependencies for a frontend project... Yikes. Did not realize at the time.

Anyway, considering how simple this app is it should be no problemt to move it to a new stack. As long as it's React it should just be some copy and paste. If you feel so inclined.

## Dev (outdated)

- Dev server: `yarn start`
- Prod build: `yarn build`
- Deploy: `git push`. Netlify deploys via webhook on push.
